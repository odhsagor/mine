								<p>Hi, I'm Md. Obidul Huq Sagor, a final-year Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student at Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB). With a passion for programming and technology, I am constantly driven to learn, innovate, and push the boundaries of what can be achieved with software. My focus lies in backend development, database management, and building systems that are both efficient and impactful. By the way, check out my <a href="#work">awesome work</a>.</p>
								<p>I am a problem solver at heart, fascinated by the potential of technology to address real-world challenges. I enjoy working on diverse projects, where I can combine creativity with technical expertise. Whether it's exploring IoT, web development, or health tech, my goal is to develop solutions that make a difference. I am committed to continuous learning and growth, always looking for opportunities to expand my skills and contribute to meaningful projects.</p>

								<p>Throughout my journey as a programmer, I’ve worked on various projects that showcase my ability to solve complex problems through technology. I have experience in backend development, where I've built systems like a patient management application, playground booking platforms, and a prescription system tailored for doctors. My skills in HTML, CSS, SCSS, JAVA, JAVASCRIPT, PHP, SQL, Python(Not Too Much) and database design have enabled me to develop efficient and scalable solutions for these applications.</p>
								<p>I’ve also explored the intersection of IoT and healthcare through projects like the 'IoT-based Smart Insulin Delivery System and Diabetes Management System' and the "Smart Health Guardian," which focuses on healthcare monitoring in rural areas using microprocessor technology.</p>
								<p>In addition to web-based systems, I've ventured into mobile app development with a Swift-based chat app called 'Talko.' I’m always looking for opportunities to apply my skills to create systems that blend functionality with purpose, particularly in health tech, communication, and innovative IoT solutions.</p>
